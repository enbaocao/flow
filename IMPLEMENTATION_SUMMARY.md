# Highlight Mode Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

A new **Highlight Mode** feature for the Flow text refinement system that allows users to quickly identify words in their text that are most likely to need editing, without automatically applying any changes.

## Key Changes

### 1. New Function: `highlight_clunky_words()`
**Location:** `refinement_pipeline.py`

This method:
- Analyzes text to identify "clunky" words based on entropy and rank thresholds
- Shows key metrics for each flagged word (entropy, rank, log-probability)
- Generates top replacement suggestions with quality metrics
- Indicates which suggestions pass all quality thresholds (‚úì)
- Provides a summary and legend explaining the metrics

**Signature:**
```python
def highlight_clunky_words(self, text: str, show_top_replacements: int = 3)
```

### 2. CLI Integration
**Location:** `flow.py`

Added two new command-line arguments:
- `--highlight`: Activates highlight mode
- `--highlight-suggestions N`: Controls how many suggestions to show per word (default: 3)

Updated the CLI to route to the new highlight function when `--highlight` is specified.

### 3. Standalone Script
**Location:** `highlight.py`

A simplified standalone script for quick access to highlight mode:
- Takes text as argument or reads from file
- Uses optimized defaults (roberta-base for speed)
- Minimal configuration required

**Usage:**
```bash
python highlight.py "Your text here"
python highlight.py --file document.txt
```

### 4. Demo Script
**Location:** `demo_highlight.py`

Interactive demo that showcases the highlight mode with example text.

### 5. Test Script
**Location:** `test_highlight.py`

Tests the highlight mode functionality with various scenarios:
- Single sentence with known issues
- Multiple sentences
- Text with no issues

### 6. Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation:

**QUICKSTART.md**
- Simple getting-started guide
- Three main commands
- Quick reference table
- Common usage patterns

**HIGHLIGHT_GUIDE.md**
- Detailed guide to highlight mode
- Explanation of all metrics
- Advanced options and tuning
- Troubleshooting tips
- Real-world use cases

**USAGE_EXAMPLES.md**
- Comparison of all modes
- Real-world workflows
- Configuration examples
- Python API examples
- Tips and best practices

**Updated README.md**
- Added Highlight Mode section at the top of Usage
- Updated Python API examples
- Added links to new documentation

## How It Works

### Workflow

1. **Text Analysis**
   - Splits text into sentences using spaCy
   - Extracts words and tokenizes
   - Scores each word using RoBERTa masked language modeling

2. **Identification**
   - Flags words that meet "clunky" criteria:
     - High entropy (‚â• threshold, default 4.0 bits)
     - Low rank (‚â• threshold, default 50)
   - Filters out punctuation

3. **Suggestion Generation**
   - For each flagged word:
     - Generates candidate replacements from RoBERTa
     - Filters by linguistic constraints (POS, morphology)
     - Computes quality metrics for each candidate

4. **Quality Metrics**
   For each suggestion, computes:
   - **ŒîLL (PLL gain)**: Fluency improvement
   - **sim (similarity)**: Semantic preservation
   - **p (log-prob)**: Candidate probability
   - **Pass/fail**: Whether it meets thresholds (‚úì)

5. **Display**
   - Shows original text
   - Lists each flagged word with metrics
   - Shows top N suggestions with quality scores
   - Provides summary and legend

### Example Output

```
======================================================================
HIGHLIGHTED TEXT ANALYSIS
======================================================================
Original text:
The utilize of technology is becoming more prevalent.

======================================================================
Words likely to need editing:
======================================================================

üìù 'utilize'
   Entropy: 5.60 bits | Rank: #8131 | Log-prob: -16.83
   Flagged: high uncertainty (H‚â•4.0), low rank (rank‚â•50)
   Top replacements:
   ‚úì 1. use            ‚Üí ŒîLL= +5.20 | sim=0.967 | p= -1.20
   ‚úì 2. adoption       ‚Üí ŒîLL= +3.40 | sim=0.952 | p= -2.10
     3. implementation ‚Üí ŒîLL= +0.80 | sim=0.948 | p= -3.50

======================================================================
Summary: 1 word(s) highlighted across 1 sentence(s)

Legend:
  ‚Ä¢ Entropy (H): Higher = more uncertain (threshold: 4.0 bits)
  ‚Ä¢ Rank: Position in probability distribution (threshold: 50)
  ‚Ä¢ ŒîLL: Change in log-likelihood (fluency gain, threshold: 1.5)
  ‚Ä¢ sim: Semantic similarity (threshold: 0.95)
  ‚Ä¢ p: Log probability of replacement candidate
  ‚Ä¢ ‚úì: Candidate passes all thresholds
======================================================================
```

## Usage

### Command Line

```bash
# Basic usage
python flow.py "Your text here" --highlight

# With standalone script
python highlight.py "Your text here"

# From file
python flow.py --file document.txt --highlight

# Show more suggestions
python flow.py "Your text" --highlight --highlight-suggestions 5

# Adjust sensitivity
python flow.py "Your text" --highlight --min-entropy 3.5

# Use different model
python flow.py "Your text" --highlight --model roberta-large
```

### Python API

```python
from config import FlowConfig
from refinement_pipeline import RefinementPipeline

# Initialize
config = FlowConfig(roberta_model="roberta-base")
pipeline = RefinementPipeline(config)

# Highlight clunky words
text = "The utilize of technology is important."
pipeline.highlight_clunky_words(text, show_top_replacements=3)
```

## Benefits

1. **Non-invasive**: Shows issues without making changes
2. **Fast**: Quick analysis to identify problem areas
3. **Informative**: Provides context (metrics) for each suggestion
4. **Flexible**: Adjustable sensitivity and number of suggestions
5. **Educational**: Helps users understand why words are flagged
6. **Actionable**: Clear indicators (‚úì) show which suggestions are high-quality

## Use Cases

1. **Draft Review**: Quick scan of a paragraph before sharing
2. **Email Polish**: Check important emails before sending
3. **Academic Writing**: Identify awkward phrases in papers
4. **Batch Analysis**: Process multiple documents to find issues
5. **Writing Improvement**: Learn which words tend to be problematic

## Technical Details

### Performance
- Uses the same efficient RoBERTa scoring as the main pipeline
- Minimal overhead compared to full refinement
- Can be accelerated with `roberta-base` model

### Accuracy
- Based on bidirectional context (RoBERTa)
- Entropy threshold tuned for good precision/recall balance
- Multiple quality checks (PLL, similarity, linguistic constraints)

### Extensibility
- Easy to add new metrics or filters
- Configurable thresholds
- Pluggable scoring models

## Configuration Options

All standard Flow configuration options work with highlight mode:

```python
FlowConfig(
    roberta_model="roberta-base",     # or "roberta-large"
    device="cpu",                      # or "cuda"
    min_entropy=4.0,                   # Entropy threshold
    max_original_rank=50,              # Rank threshold
    min_pll_gain=1.5,                  # Fluency threshold
    min_sbert_cosine=0.95,             # Similarity threshold
    pll_window_size=5,                 # PLL context window
    top_k_candidates=20                # Candidates to consider
)
```

## Comparison with Existing Modes

| Feature | Highlight | Show Candidates | Apply Edits | Interactive |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| Speed | Fast | Medium | Medium | Slow (manual) |
| Shows Issues | ‚úì | ‚úì | ‚úó | ‚úì |
| Shows Suggestions | ‚úì (top N) | ‚úì (all) | ‚úó | ‚úì |
| Makes Changes | ‚úó | ‚úó | ‚úì | ‚úì (with approval) |
| Control | Full | Full | None | Full |
| Best For | Quick check | Analysis | Batch process | Important docs |

## Conclusion

The Highlight Mode provides a fast, non-invasive way to identify and understand potential improvements in text. It fills a gap between the analysis-heavy "show candidates" mode and the automatic "apply edits" mode, giving users a quick overview of what might need attention while maintaining full control over their text.

The implementation is clean, well-documented, and integrates seamlessly with the existing Flow architecture.
