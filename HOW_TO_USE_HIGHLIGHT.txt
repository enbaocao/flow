  FLOW HIGHLIGHT MODE - COPY & PASTE WORKFLOW
================================================================================

WHAT YOU WANTED:
Copy and paste in a paragraph, and it tells you (highlights) places that are 
most likely to need an edit (where probabilities for alternate words/phrases 
are particularly high).

HOW TO USE IT:
================================================================================

METHOD 1: Quick Command (Recommended)
--------------------------------------
python flow.py "Your paragraph here" --highlight


METHOD 2: Using Standalone Script
----------------------------------
python highlight.py "Your paragraph here"


METHOD 3: From a File
---------------------
python flow.py --file document.txt --highlight


EXAMPLE:
================================================================================

$ python flow.py "The utilize of advanced technology has revolutionized the way we communicate." --highlight

Output:
------
üìù 'utilize'
   Entropy: 5.60 bits | Rank: #8131 | Log-prob: -16.83
   Flagged: high uncertainty (H‚â•4.0), low rank (rank‚â•50)
   Top replacements:
   ‚úì 1. use            ‚Üí ŒîLL= +5.20 | sim=0.967 | p= -1.20
   ‚úì 2. adoption       ‚Üí ŒîLL= +3.40 | sim=0.952 | p= -2.10
     3. implementation ‚Üí ŒîLL= +0.80 | sim=0.948 | p= -3.50

Summary: 1 word(s) highlighted across 1 sentence(s)


WHAT THE OUTPUT MEANS:
================================================================================

üìù 'utilize'               <- This word is flagged as needing editing
   Entropy: 5.60 bits     <- High uncertainty (awkward choice)
   Rank: #8131            <- Very low probability word
   
   ‚úì 1. use               <- ‚úì means this passes all quality checks
      ŒîLL= +5.20          <- Makes sentence more fluent (+5.20 improvement)
      sim=0.967           <- Preserves meaning (96.7% similar)


CUSTOMIZATION:
================================================================================

Show more suggestions per word:
   python flow.py "text" --highlight --highlight-suggestions 5

More sensitive (catch more issues):
   python flow.py "text" --highlight --min-entropy 3.5

Less sensitive (only obvious issues):
   python flow.py "text" --highlight --min-entropy 5.0

Faster analysis (use base model):
   python flow.py "text" --highlight --model roberta-base

More accurate (use large model):
   python flow.py "text" --highlight --model roberta-large


TYPICAL WORKFLOW:
================================================================================

1. Copy your paragraph
2. Run: python flow.py "paste here" --highlight
3. Review the highlighted words and suggestions
4. Manually edit your text based on the suggestions (with ‚úì marks)
5. Done!


WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
================================================================================

‚úì Look for the ‚úì checkmark - these suggestions pass all quality checks
‚úì High ŒîLL values (+3 or higher) = significant fluency improvement
‚úì High sim values (0.95+) = meaning is preserved
‚úì Multiple suggestions with ‚úì = strong agreement that word needs changing


QUICK TIPS:
================================================================================

‚Ä¢ Start with default settings (they're well-tuned)
‚Ä¢ Trust suggestions with ‚úì marks
‚Ä¢ Use roberta-base for speed, roberta-large for accuracy
‚Ä¢ You always have final control - it only suggests, you decide
‚Ä¢ If nothing is highlighted, your text is already good!


TROUBLESHOOTING:
================================================================================

Too many words highlighted?
   -> Increase threshold: --min-entropy 5.0

Nothing highlighted but you want to check?
   -> Decrease threshold: --min-entropy 3.5

Running slow?
   -> Use faster model: --model roberta-base

Want to see more suggestions?
   -> Use: --highlight-suggestions 5
